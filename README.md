The main repository to work on 'Clean Machine' app.
Every aspect of app works properly here and it will be the easiest way to share and collaborate on the project.

I created this because I wasn't able to figure out
how to properly move the app into the Projects' folder of the Group39-FA21 repository without receiving multiple errors.

Our original MVP was to allow our user to scan the recycling item, 
and then use Machine Learning to tell the user where to recycle the item.
However, we weren't able to figure it out and as a result, we switched
to a text based description that the user types.
