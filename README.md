The main repository to work on 'Clean Machine' app.
Every aspect of app works properly here and it will be the easiest way to share and collaborate on the project.

Our original MVP was to allow our user to scan the recycling item, and then use Machine Learning to tell the user where to recycle the item.
However, due to time constraints, we changed our MVP to a text based description that the user inputs.
